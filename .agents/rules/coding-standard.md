## Coding standards

1. Use latest versions of libraries and idiomatic approaches as of today
2. Keep it simple - NEVER over-engineer, ALWAYS simplify, NO unnecessary defensive programming. No extra features - focus on simplicity.
3. When hitting issues, always identify root cause before trying a fix. Do not guess. Prove with evidence, then fix the root cause.
