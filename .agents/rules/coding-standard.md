## Coding standards

1. Use latest versions of libraries and idiomatic approaches as of today
2. Keep it simple - NEVER over-engineer, ALWAYS simplify, NO unnecessary defensive programming. No extra features - focus on simplicity, readability, maintainability, performance, security, and conciseness.
3. When hitting issues, always identify root cause before trying a fix. Do not guess. Prove with evidence, then fix the root cause and prove that the issues are fixed.
4. Review the code and fix all errors and warnings so it completely passes `npm run lint` before committing to git.
